        "\n",
        "The main idea is to structure software so that it's easier to manage, reuse, and scale. OOP is especially helpful when modeling complex systems.\n",
        "#2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "->In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is essentially a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Components of a Class:\n",
        "###Attributes (Properties or Fields):\n",

        "#4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "->The primary difference between abstraction and encapsulation is that abstraction is a design level process that focuses on hiding the complex details and implementation of the code.

        "->In Python, a static method is a function within a class that doesn't have access to the class or instance state, while a class method is bound to the class itself (accessed via the class name) and receives the class as its first argument (cls).\n",
        "#11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, method overloading, while not directly supported like in some other languages, is achieved through techniques like default arguments and variable-length arguments, allowing a single function to handle different inputs and behaviors.\n",
        "#12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "->In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, enabling specialized behavior while maintaining the same method signature.\n",
        "#13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "->The Python property decorator makes attributes in a class act like read-only properties. Essentially, it lets you access methods as if they were attributes, without needing to write parentheses.\n",
        "#14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "->Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting adaptable and modular software systems\n",
        "#15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "In Python, an abstract class is a blueprint for other classes, designed to be subclassed but not instantiated directly, containing one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "#16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "->Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers advantages like improved code organization, reusability through inheritance, enhanced flexibility with polymorphism, and simplification of complex systems through abstraction, leading to modular, maintainable, and scalable software solutions\n",
        "#17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "->Class variables (also known as static variables) are shared among all instances of a class, meaning they have one copy for the entire class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are specific to each individual object (instance) of a class, with each object having its own separate copy\n",
        "#18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, multiple inheritance allows a class (the child class) to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. This means a child class can inherit properties from more than one base class, combining their functionalities.\n",
        "#19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods used to define how objects are represented as strings. __str__ is for a human-readable, informal representation (e.g., for users), while __repr__ provides a more formal, developer-focused representation that can often be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "#20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, the super() function is a built-in function that allows a subclass to access and call methods of its parent (or super) class, facilitating inheritance and code reusability.\n",
        "#21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, the __del__() method is a destructor that's automatically called by the garbage collector when an object's reference count reaches zero, signaling that the object is about to be destroyed. It's primarily used for cleaning up resources or performing final actions before an object is deallocated, though its reliability can be affected by the garbage collector's timing.\n",
        "#22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "->n Python, @classmethod binds a method to the class, allowing access to the class itself (via cls), while @staticmethod defines a method that belongs to the class but doesn't have access to either the class or instance.\n",
        "#23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "->In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works through method overriding, where child classes can redefine methods inherited from parent classes, allowing the same method name to have different implementations based on the object type.\n",
        "#24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "->Method chaining in Python allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, improving readability and conciseness. It's achieved by having methods return the object itself (usually self), allowing subsequent method calls to be chained using the dot notation.\n",
        "#25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "->The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to make instances of a class callable, allowing them to be invoked like functions. When you define a __call__ method within a class, you enable instances of that class to be called using parentheses, as if they were functions"
